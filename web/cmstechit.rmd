# 4. Design Style Guide (The "Ventriloc" Look)

| Element | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Typography** | **Headings:** Bold Serif (e.g., *Playfair Display* or *Sentient*). **Body:** Modern Sans-Serif (e.g., *Inter* or *Neue Montreal*). |
| **Color Palette** | Background: `#1A1817` (Deep Coffee/Black). Accents: `#FF5722` (Burning Orange). Text: `#F5F5F5` (Off-White). |
| **Imagery** | Use high-quality abstract 3D renders, dashboard mockups, and minimalist technical diagrams. Avoid generic "handshake" stock photos. |
| **Layout** | Use plenty of white space (negative space). Avoid rigid borders; use organic transitions and subtle scroll animations. |

# 5. Implementation Process
1.  **Wireframing:** Map the flow to ensure a "storytelling" experience.
2.  **Copywriting:** Use the "Premium" tone established above.
3.  **Development:** Build using a headless CMS (like Strapi or Contentful) or a custom WordPress build with a minimalist front-end framework.
4.  **SEO Strategy:** Target keywords like "Enterprise Software Solutions," "Managed IT Services," and "Custom Web Development."
